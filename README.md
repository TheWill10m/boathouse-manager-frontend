# Boathouse Manager Frontend

A React app frontend created with Vite.

This web application was created as a way for me to demonstrate my current knowledge of React. This application allows the user to manage a, stateless, inventory of rowing boats.

## Currently implemented features
- Display list of boats
- ADD new boats
- DELETE boats
- UPDATE existing boats

## Not implemented features
- Integration with API backend
- Instruction for running Docker container
- Example docker-compose file

---

## How to install and run the project

Currently, the application can only be run in development mode, using the Vite development environment. To do this, you need to clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the application.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TheWill10m/boathouse-manager-frontend.git
cd boathouse-manager-frontend

npm install
npm run dev
```
